## 🔥 For Multi-Section Schedules (e.g., Core, Elective 1, Elective 2):
If you need schedules for multiple sections:
- **Run the app 3 times** (once for each section).
- **Generate 3 separate CSV files** — one for each section.

This way, you’ll have clean, easy-to-read schedules for all your classes!  

Happy scheduling! 🎉
